# bpm-fpb-tapper
It's a timing program for animators

I wrote this cos I needed it for timing in one of my cartoons

Mind you I strictly defined the program and had grok (4) write the thing

And it works tr√®s bien

I have the source code file here and the .exe for windows users

to compile it have gcc installed and run `gcc bpm-fpb-tapper.c -o bpm-fpb-tapper`
